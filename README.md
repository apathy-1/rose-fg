# rose-fg &nbsp;·&nbsp; v10.0
> A private, offline-first toolkit for network intelligence, OSINT, Discord automation, and developer utilities — built with Python and CustomTkinter.

---

## What is rose-fg?

rose-fg is a personal desktop application that consolidates a wide range of security, networking, encoding, and developer tools into a single dark-themed GUI. It is designed to be run locally with no telemetry, no accounts, and no cloud dependency. Everything runs on your machine.

This tool is not intended for re-distribution.

## Setup & Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A virtual environment is strongly recommended

### 1. Clone or download the project

```
git clone https://github.com/DuckzPY/rose-fg/
cd tool
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install customtkinter pillow qrcode[pil]
```

Optional but recommended for full System Info support:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

For WHOIS lookups (if the system `whois` binary is unavailable):

```bash
pip install python-whois
```
Or run the requirements.bat file to install them automatically

### 4. Run

```bash
python rose-fg.py
```

> **Important:** Always launch via the terminal with the venv active. Running the script by double-clicking or via a shortcut will likely fail with import errors because it won't use the venv's Python.

### Font Note

rose-fg uses **JetBrains Mono** and **Inter**. If these aren't installed on your system the UI will fall back to a system default — it won't crash, but it won't look as intended. Install both fonts for the best experience.

- Default tab on launch
- Settings persist to `~/.rose-fg_settings.json`

## Usage Notes

- **Sidebar navigation** — sections are collapsible. Click a section header to expand/collapse it. Active tools are highlighted in red.
- **Output boxes** — all output is colour-coded: red = success, red = error, yellow = warning, cyan = info, dim = metadata.
- **Threaded operations** — network tools run in background threads so the UI never freezes. Use the Stop button in Port Scanner to interrupt a long scan.
- **Drag & drop** — File Hash and File Info support drag and drop if tkinterdnd2 is available; otherwise use the Browse button.
- **Discord tools** — require a bot token with appropriate permissions. The bot must be in the server for most guild-level tools. DM Sender requires the bot to share a server with the target user.
- **WHOIS** — uses the system `whois` binary if available, falls back to `python-whois`, and will attempt to auto-install it via pip if neither is found.

## File Structure

```
tool/
├── main.py               # Entire application — single file
├── rose_logo.png         # Sidebar logo (optional — falls back to animated dot)
├── .venv/                # Virtual environment (not committed)
├── README.md             # This file
```

Settings and notes are stored in the user's home directory:

```
~/.rose-fg_settings.json
~/.rose-fg_notes.txt
```

---

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `customtkinter` | Modern themed Tkinter widgets |
| `pillow` | Image handling for logo and QR display |
| `qrcode[pil]` | QR code generation |
| `psutil` *(optional)* | CPU, RAM, and hardware stats in System Info |
| `python-whois` *(optional)* | WHOIS fallback if system binary unavailable |

All other imports (`socket`, `threading`, `urllib`, `subprocess`, `ssl`, `hashlib`, `base64`, `re`, `difflib`, `uuid`, etc.) are Python standard library.

---

## Known Limitations

- Username Checker results are based on HTTP response codes only — some platforms return 200 for non-existent accounts or block bot user agents, so results may not be perfectly accurate.
- Crypto prices and exchange rates depend on free public APIs (CoinGecko, exchangerate-api) which have rate limits.
- Traceroute on Windows uses `tracert` and may be slow or blocked by firewalls.
- Port Scanner is single-threaded per port — large ranges (e.g. 1–65535) will take a long time even at max speed.
- Drag & drop file support requires `tkinterdnd2` which is not included in the default install.

---

## Privacy

- No data is sent anywhere except by the tools that explicitly make network requests (lookups, Discord API calls, crypto prices, etc.).
- No analytics, no logging, no crash reporting.
- Settings and notes are stored locally only.
- Discord bot tokens are entered per-session and never written to disk.
